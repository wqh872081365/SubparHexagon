About the Game
-------------
This game was a weeklong project I set myself between finishing work and university starting back up.  I wanted to try out Unity and I am big fan of Terry Cavanagh's work so I thought I would take a crack at remaking Super Hexagon.  

I'm really pleased with the results.  The code is a bit rushed and the controls could do with a little tuning but I think it looks really good and I learnt a ton doing it.
